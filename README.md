# This is a very simple way for you to be able to keep track of all your books. It comes with
# a user menu where you can add a book, see a list of your books, delete a book from your list,
# mark a book read and just hit 'q' to quit the python program. The books you enter get saved
# into a database and will stay there until removed.

# Happy saving!!!!!
